# 1 - Introduction

This project aims to investigate and analyze key character emotions, interactions, and patterns in the iconic ***FRIENDS*** TV show using a variety of datasets. By understanding how emotions evolve over time and the interaction patterns of characters, we can uncover insights about character development and audience engagement.

# 2 - Workspace Setup

```{python}
#| label: workspace-setup
#| code-summary: Workspace Setup

# Importing Necessary Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px

# Setting Plot Styles
sns.set_theme(style = "white")

# Importing Datasets
friends_df = pd.read_csv('data/friends.csv')
friends_emotions_df = pd.read_csv('data/friends_emotions.csv')
friends_info_df = pd.read_csv('data/friends_info.csv')
```

# 3 - Data

###### FRIENDS

1.  Columns - `text`, `speaker`, `season`, `episode`, `scene`, `utterance`.
2.  Rows - 67373
3.  Info - This dataset contains EACH & EVERY line of dialogue that is spoken in the show, providing us with a rich database for analyzing chracter interactions & speech patterns.

###### FRIENDS_EMOTIONS

1.  Columns - `season`, `episode`, `scene`, `utterance`, `emotion`.
2.  Rows - 12606
3.  Info - This dataset provides an EMOTIONAL label for each line, allowing for an in - depth analysis of character emotions across episodes & seasons.

###### FRIENDS_INFO

1.  Columns - `season`, `episode`, `title`, `directed_by`, `written_by`, `air_data`, `us_views_millions`, `imdb_rating`.
2.  Rows - 236
3.  Info - This dataset is CRUCIAL for contextualizing the show's progression, viewership trends, and episode quality.

I have chosen these ***FRIENDS*** datasets because, well I love the show; which for me is the ONLY reason. But for a more professional reason, these datasets provide an incredibly detailed glimpse into one of the **MOST BELOVED** TV shows of all time.

As a massive fan, I am honestly interested about each of our ***FRIENDS*** development over time. This really might prove to be a treasure chest - containing insights into their emotions & personalities that have captivated the audience for decades (me personally few years).

Exploring this dataset is like 'breaking the 4th Wall' for me, discovering the emotional highs and lows, understanding some intricate bonds between our ***FRIENDS*** & even predicting how future episodes might unfold based on certain recurring factors.

# 4 - Questions

1.  Which character dominates the dialogue in each EP and/or SS ?

2.  Which character uses the most positive or optimistic language throughout the series ?

3.  Can we predict which character will dominate an episode based on the director, episode rating, and viewership ?

# 5 - Analysis Plan

1.  Character Dominance Analysis :
    1.  Variables Involved : `speaker`, `season`, `episode`, `scene`, `utterance`.
    2.  Plan :
        -   Group by `season`, `episode`, and `scene` to isolate dialogue counts within a scene; while by `season`, `episode` to isolate counts within episode.
        -   Aggregate `utterance` counts for each of the FRIENDS to find the one with the most dialogue.
        -   Visualize Results.
2.  Language Usage :
    1.  Variables Involved : `season`, `episode`, `speaker`, `text`.
    2.  Plan :
        -   Perform sentimental analysis on the `text` field to evaluate the tone.
        -   Sum and compare scores by character.
        -   Visualize Results.
3.  Character Dominance Prediction :
    1.  Variables Involved : `season`, `episode`, `directed_by`, `us_views_millions`, `imdb_rating`, `speaker`, `utterance`
    2.  Plan :
        -   Aggregate dialogue count per episode by character.
        -   Develop a predictive model using `directed_by`, `us_views_millions`, `imdb_rating` as features.
        -   Visualize Results.
