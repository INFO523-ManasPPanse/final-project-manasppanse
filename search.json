By understanding how emotions evolve over time and the interaction patterns of characters, we can uncover insights about character development and audience engagement.\n\n\n2 - Workspace Setup\n\n\nWorkspace Setup\n# Importing Necessary Libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Setting Plot Styles\nsns.set_theme(style = \"white\")\n\n# Importing Datasets\nfriends_df = pd.read_csv('data/friends.csv')\nfriends_emotions_df = pd.read_csv('data/friends_emotions.csv')\nfriends_info_df = pd.read_csv('data/friends_info.csv')\n\n\n\n\n3 - Data\n\n\nFriends Info\n# FRIENDS\nfriends_df.info()\n\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 67373 entries, 0 to 67372\nData columns (total 6 columns):\n #   Column     Non-Null Count  Dtype \n---  ------     --------------  ----- \n 0   text       67373 non-null  object\n 1   speaker    67097 non-null  object\n 2   season     67373 non-null  int64 \n 3   episode    67373 non-null  int64 \n 4   scene      67373 non-null  int64 \n 5   utterance  67373 non-null  int64 \ndtypes: int64(4), object(2)\nmemory usage: 3.1+ MB\n\n\n\n\nFriends-Emotions Info\n# FRIENDS_EMOTIONS\nfriends_emotions_df.info()\n\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 12606 entries, 0 to 12605\nData columns (total 5 columns):\n #   Column     Non-Null Count  Dtype \n---  ------     --------------  ----- \n 0   season     12606 non-null  int64 \n 1   episode    12606 non-null  int64 \n 2   scene      12606 non-null  int64 \n 3   utterance  12606 non-null  int64 \n 4   emotion    12606 non-null  object\ndtypes: int64(4), object(1)\nmemory usage: 492.6+ KB\n\n\n\n\nFriends-Info Info\n# FRIENDS_INFO\nfriends_info_df.info()\n\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 236 entries, 0 to 235\nData columns (total 8 columns):\n #   Column             Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------             --------------  -----  \n 0   season             236 non-null    int64  \n 1   episode            236 non-null    int64  \n 2   title              236 non-null    object \n 3   directed_by        236 non-null    object \n 4   written_by         236 non-null    object \n 5   air_date           236 non-null    object \n 6   us_views_millions  236 non-null    float64\n 7   imdb_rating        236 non-null    float64\ndtypes: float64(2), int64(2), object(4)\nmemory usage: 14.9+ KB\n\n\n\nFRIENDS\n\nColumns - text, speaker, season, episode, scene, utterance.\nRows - 67373\nInfo - This dataset contains EACH & EVERY line of dialogue that is spoken in the show, providing us with a rich database for analyzing chracter interactions & speech patterns.\n\n\n\nFRIENDS_EMOTIONS\n\nColumns - season, episode, scene, utterance, emotion.\nRows - 12606\nInfo - This dataset provides an EMOTIONAL label for each line, allowing for an in - depth analysis of character emotions across episodes & seasons.\n\n\n\nFRIENDS_INFO\n\nColumns - season, episode, title, directed_by, written_by, air_data, us_views_millions, imdb_rating.\nRows - 236\nInfo - This dataset is CRUCIAL for contextualizing the show’s progression, viewership trends, and episode quality.\n\nI have chosen these FRIENDS datasets because, well I love the show; which for me is the ONLY reason. But for a more professional reason, these datasets provide an incredibly detailed glimpse into one of the MOST BELOVED TV shows of all time.\nAs a massive fan, I am honestly interested about each of our FRIENDS development over time. This really might prove to be a treasure chest - containing insights into their emotions & personalities that have captivated the audience for decades (me personally few years).\nExploring this dataset is like ‘breaking the 4th Wall’ for me, discovering the emotional highs and lows, understanding some intricate bonds between our FRIENDS & even predicting how future episodes might unfold based on certain recurring factors.\n\n\n\n4 - Questions\n\nWhich character dominates the dialogue in each EP and/or SS ?\nWhich character uses the most positive or optimistic language throughout the series ?\nCan we predict which character will dominate an episode based on the director, episode rating, and viewership ?\n\n\n\n5 - Analysis Plan\n\nCharacter Dominance Analysis :\n\nVariables Involved : speaker, season, episode, scene, utterance.\nPlan :\n\nGroup by season, episode, and scene to isolate dialogue counts within a scene; while by season, episode to isolate counts within episode.\nAggregate utterance counts for each of the FRIENDS to find the one with the most dialogue.\nVisualize Results.\n\n\nLanguage Usage :\n\nVariables Involved : season, episode, speaker, text.\nPlan :\n\nPerform sentimental analysis on the text field to evaluate the tone.\nSum and compare scores by character.\nVisualize Results.\n\n\nCharacter Dominance Prediction :\n\nVariables Involved : season, episode, directed_by, us_views_millions, imdb_rating, speaker, utterance\nPlan :\n\nAggregate dialogue count per episode by character.\nDevelop a predictive model using directed_by, us_views_millions, imdb_rating as features.\nVisualize Results.\n\n\n\n\n\n6 - Plan of Attack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Name\nStatus\nDue\nPriority\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nProject Proposal and Initial Research\nComplete\n03-Nov-24\nHigh\nOutline project goals, research questions, and data sources, centered on Friends TV show.\n\n\nProject Proposal for Initial Instructor Review\nCompleted\n03-Nov-24\nHigh\nSubmit the project proposal for instructor review, outlining goals, research questions, and data sources focused on Friends character dialogue and emotions.\n\n\nProject Proposal for Final Instructor Review\nIncomplete\n10-Nov-24\nHigh\nAmend the proposal.qmd with feedback from instructor & submit for final review.\n\n\nFinalizing Project Outline\nIncomplete\n\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning and Preparation\nIncomplete\nx\nMedium\nClean friends_df, friends_emotions_df, and friends_info_df, handling nulls, duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.\n\n\nCharacter Dialogue Analysis\nIncomplete\nx\nMedium\nIdentify which character dominates the dialogue in each episode and scene, aggregating by speaker, season, and episode.\n\n\nEmotion Analysis Per Character\nIncomplete\nx\nMedium\nAnalyze which character uses the most positive or optimistic language across the series using friends_emotions_df.\n\n\nPredictive Analysis\nIncomplete\nx\nMedium\nDevelop a model to predict the character likely to dominate an episode based on director, episode rating, and viewership.\n\n\nVisualization Development\nIncomplete\nx\nMedium\nCreate visualizations for each analysis question, including bar charts, donut charts, and heatmaps, to effectively show findings.\n\n\nReport Compilation\nIncomplete\nx\nLow\nCompile findings and visualizations into a structured report, narrating the analysis process and conclusions.\n\n\nPresentation Preparation\nIncomplete\nx\nLow\nCreate a final presentation summarizing key project insights for effective communication and sharing.\n\n\nFinal Submission\nIncomplete\nx\nLow\nSubmit all project files, including report, dashboard, and visualizations, and publish any related content on GitHub or a website."
